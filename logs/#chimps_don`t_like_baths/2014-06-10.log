17:47:48 <Gil_Gamesh> geannie?
17:48:45 <icy`butterfly> Hey Gil.
17:48:54 <Gil_Gamesh> Hey. Cool :-)
17:49:19 <Gil_Gamesh> I think I have all the updates done - and I was about to send it to you - but we need to fuss with the database a little.
17:49:56 <icy`butterfly> Ah, okay.
17:50:00 <Gil_Gamesh> Your copy won't have the table for the pooled intros and mine won't be up to date with changes made in #wd for the last day or two.
17:50:05 <icy`butterfly> I have a bit of time before work to do that.
17:50:09 <icy`butterfly> Ah, right.
17:50:11 <Gil_Gamesh> Ok - should only take a few.
17:50:33 <Gil_Gamesh> Shut him down in #wd and email me your IgorProfiles.db
17:50:34 <icy`butterfly> okay, let me get my kb cleared off.
17:51:00 <icy`butterfly> i have metal rings everywhere!
17:51:04 <Gil_Gamesh> I'll add in the intro stuff to your copy, stick it into the updated version and email it back to you.
17:51:12 <Gil_Gamesh> Lol! Making a collar?
17:51:28 <icy`butterfly> lol
17:51:29 <icy`butterfly> Not this time.
17:51:36 <icy`butterfly> Chain mail bra, actually.
17:51:45 <Gil_Gamesh> Lol - oooh! Sounds racy!
17:52:08 <Gil_Gamesh> Do you, uh, need someone to measure your customers?
17:52:58 <icy`butterfly> LOL
17:53:01 <icy`butterfly> Quite measured!
17:53:51 <Gil_Gamesh> Lol - ah well.
17:54:00 <icy`butterfly> Lol
17:54:06 <icy`butterfly> Profiles emailed.
17:54:14 <Gil_Gamesh> Terrific - be as quick as I can!
17:54:39 <icy`butterfly> Sweet.
